# UFOs

## Overview
Dana has developed a webpage that allows users to search for UFO sightings across the globe. In order to improve the user experience, she would like to add a few more search criteria that can assist the user to narrow down their search. Currently, we are only able to populate results based on date, but Dana would like to add city, state, country, and shape options.

<b>Here is what the webpage looked like prior to the search additions:</b>

<b>Here is our webpage now with updates:</b>

If you would like to test out the webpage please visit [UFO Sightings](https://lopezroxann.github.io/UFOs/).


## Results
If we take a look at the updated screen shot above, we can see that there is currently no specific criteria entered to populate results.
Therefore, all results are populated.

Let's first narrow down our search to the state of California in the US:

We get a lot of results! We can narrow this down even further. Let's add the city of El Cajon:

What if we don't want a specific city, but a specific date of sightings in California? 
Let's filter by date instead of city:

There are so many ways to search for various sightings now instead of being dependent on date alone.

## Summary

- <b>Drawbacks:</b></br>
The data is limited on our webpage. We can only search through results that occured in January 2010 in the United States and Canada.
That is a major drawback because it limits our search to a very small window in time and location.

- <b>Improvements:</b></br>
What I would like to add is a tally of the search results, as well as being able to extract the data into excel or PDF form.
Another big improvement would be a section where those who have experienced a UFO sighting can submit their information on a designated form on the site. That way the data is continually being updated and we have more access to data around the globe.
